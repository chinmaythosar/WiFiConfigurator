# WiFiConfigurator

Selenium Python Script to Configure a WiFi Router in Seconds.

This one was specifically made for the TP-Link 841n v13 (and should work mostly on modern TP-Link routers that have similar GUI) but if anyone finds this interesting I can generalize it so that most routers can work. I personally own this router and so I can reset it and just run this script once in a while.

While this is nowhere close to being a sophesticated one, I found it interesting that most people dont change their default settings and instead have unusual WiFi names and are set on channels that cause issues for others in the area.

Requirements : chrome webdriver

running the script : $python3 TP-Link.py
